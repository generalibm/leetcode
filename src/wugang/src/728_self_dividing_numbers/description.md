**Description:**    
A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.  
For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.  
Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.  
Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.   

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** left = 1, right = 22  
**Output:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]  

**Notes:**  
The boundaries of each input argument are 1 <= left <= right <= 10000.
