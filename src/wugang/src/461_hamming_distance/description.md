**Description**  
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.  
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.  

**Note:**  
0 ≤ x, y < 2^31.  

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** x = 1, y = 4
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
